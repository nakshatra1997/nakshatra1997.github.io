    "0": "The Lunar Eclipse during the Full Moon on June 5th asks you to think about a recent adventure or journey; something is left undone from this event, and it matters. Between June 6th and 13th, your priority should be understanding what you have learned recently about your spiritual purpose in this lifetime. The Sun squares up to Mars on June 6th and your impatience may be at breaking point, but don\u2019t give up. You don\u2019t have all of the facts yet, but more will become clear during the Sun-Neptune square on June 11th and the mid-month Mars-Neptune conjunction on June 13th.\n\nWhen Mercury turns retrograde on June 18th, it\u2019s the perfect time to reflect on your childhood or your past. The solstice and the Solar Eclipse on June 21st are further opportunities to learn from what has happened before. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up repeating certain lessons again and again. It\u2019s time to heal from family trauma and to forgive yourself and others for decisions you unknowingly made years ago. Use the reflective period offered by Neptune\u2019s retrograde, which begins on June 23rd, to come to grips with this.\n\nYour patience will be rewarded on June 27th when Mars, your ruling planet, returns to your sign. A burst of confidence, optimism, and positivity will more than make up for the month\u2019s other frustrations and delays, and an important Jupiter-Pluto conjunction on June 30th heralds long-awaited career success. You\u2019re in the right place at the right time \u2013 now go for it!",
    "1": "It may be time to re-think your long-term objectives this June. The Lunar Eclipse on June 5th finds you suffering from some guilt and regret, but it\u2019s important not to dwell on this for long. A tense square between the Sun and Mars on June 6th highlights areas where you have failed to meet your objectives so far, perhaps due to financial constraints. This isn\u2019t a great feeling, but it\u2019s important to be able to understand where you currently are on your path.\n\nThat clarity of mind matters, because your monthly horoscope forecasts that things are about to get confusing. A square from the Sun to Neptune on June 11th muddies the waters, and Mars\u2019 conjunction with Neptune on June 13th makes you turn your anger towards yourself. However, none of this is your fault. You\u2019ve done the best you can with what you have. Get rid of guilt and instead, as Mercury turns retrograde on June 18th, focus on revisiting your positive qualities, skills, and undoubted abilities.\n\nThe solstice and the Solar Eclipse on June 21st are positive moments for you. You\u2019ll be able to think more clearly now about where you want to head and how you can get there. Neptune\u2019s retrograde period, beginning on June 23rd, will help you to judge which of your objectives were mere illusions, versus what you truly want for yourself.\n\nBy the time Mars arrives in your spiritual zone on June 27th, you\u2019ll have a much better understanding of your life purpose. A stunning conjunction between Jupiter and Pluto on June 30th will help you take early steps towards manifesting something special.",
    "2": "You\u2019re set to learn a lot about your career ambitions during June, Gemini, but there will be some financial blips along the way. Your monthly horoscope begins with a Lunar Eclipse in your love zone, which urges you to keep your loved ones up to speed with your plans. However, the following day, June 6th, a tense Sun-Mars square highlights your personal frustration in your work-life and how you feel side-lined or unappreciated in your career.\n\nThis frustration may only increase during the following week, Gemini, when the Sun squares Neptune on June 11th, and then Mars conjuncts Neptune on June 13th. Avoid doing anything drastic at this time, however, as your thinking is foggy and confused. Mercury turns retrograde in your money, values, and resources zone on June 18th, which traditionally suggests a temporary slowdown in your income. In practice, however, this gives you the chance for a skills audit \u2013 discover what your strongest skills are and learn to value yourself instead of expecting others to cheerlead for you.\n\nThe solstice and the Solar Eclipse in your money zone on June 21st will help you to understand how your value does not solely depend on how much you earn. In this way, you can re-think your career frustration, Gemini, and Neptune turning retrograde on June 23rd will help with this process. Mars arrives in your humanitarian zone on June 27th with a huge burst of energy, and you may then understand that what you do matters more than how much you are paid for it.

When Mercury turns retrograde on June 18th, take the opportunity to go back over your views and to see if you, or they, have changed in any way.

The Lunar Eclipse during the Full Moon on June 5th occurs in your thinking zone and suggests that you\u2019re not being entirely realistic, which can lead to disappointment. Indeed, the following day, a tense square between the Sun and Mars highlights a situation where your idealism doesn\u2019t sit well alongside the day-to-day practicalities of life: what you ideally want is simply not doable right now.

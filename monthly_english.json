September 2nd has a Full Moon in your most spiritual and secretive zone, which makes you feel unusually sensitive to begin with \u2013 this is swiftly followed by family arguments later that same day, courtesy of the Venus-Saturn opposition, and confusion over responsibilities at work, brought about by Mercury\u2019s interaction first with Pluto and then with Saturn. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if you felt on edge, but fortunately Mercury shifts into your love zone on September 5th, and Venus moves into your fun zone on September 6th \u2013 expect the energy to lighten considerably at that point.\n\nPhysically, your energy will drop on September 9th when Mars, your ruling planet, turns retrograde in your own sign.

The Full Moon in your community zone on September 2nd asks some difficult questions about who you\u2019re involved with and why, and the Venus-Saturn opposition on that same day forces you to defend your beliefs. You may also face some hostility for your views around September 3rd, when Mercury trines Saturn in an unhelpful manner. This blip won\u2019t last too long, however and when Mercury moves into your everyday business zone on September 5th, you\u2019ll feel much more at ease. Loving Venus shifts into your family zone the following day, which is always good news.\n\nDon\u2019t feel forced to socialize mid-month if you don\u2019t feel like it.

    "2": "Financial worries may get September off to an uneasy start for you, Gemini. The Full Moon on September 2nd shines from your career zone and spotlights any anxieties you have there. The same day, a Venus-Saturn opposition brings debt and financial constraints to the fore, and the day after that, Mercury trines Saturn lending a serious air to family discussions about finances. Don\u2019t stress out about this too much. It won\u2019t last. On September 5th, Mercury moves into your creative zone and you\u2019ll find it much easier to come up with ideas and solutions.

    "3": "Early September may be a testing time in your relationship. The Full Moon on September 2nd highlights your ideals, but a Mercury-Pluto indicates where these are falling short, particularly concerning a communication breakdown in your love life. The same day, the Venus-Saturn opposition underlines this further and could create a stalemate with your partner. Getting your point across is still difficult on September 3rd, when a Mercury-Saturn trine implicates your love zone and your communication zone.\n\nFortunately, Mercury moves into fair-minded Libra on September 5th, making it much easier to negotiate with your sweetheart. Venus is on the move too, into your money and resources zone on September 6th, easing any financial pressure which was impacting your relationship.

    "4": "People are expecting too much from you as September begins. The Full Moon on September 2nd has a resentful feel to it and as Mercury trines Pluto the day prior, you may be wondering why you can\u2019t seem to put your own interests first. The Venus-Saturn opposition on September 2nd also highlights onerous responsibilities towards others, as does the Mercury-Saturn trine the following day. Help is at hand, however \u2013 when Mercury moves into your communication zone on September 5th, you\u2019ll be able to ask for help when you need it, and to delegate more. The arrival of Venus in your own sign on September 6th is also a clear signal that you will be able to put yourself first for a while.\n\nExpect some confusion or deception around money issues mid-month, particularly when the Sun opposes Neptune on September 11th. Your patience is wearing thin, not helped by Mars having turned retrograde a few days earlier in your idealism zone. However, try not to judge people without having the full facts.\n\nMuch better news about money comes with the delightful Venus-Uranus square on September 15th, which suggests promising career developments arising out of the blue.

    "5": "Early September may find you experiencing something of a crisis of confidence, Virgo. The Full Moon in your love zone on September 2nd underlines any unease there has been recently in a relationship, and at the same time a difficult Mercury-Pluto trine makes you feel like an outsider. This feeling continues, with the Venus-Saturn opposition on the same day potentially isolating you socially, while the Mercury-Saturn trine on September 3rd brings out the worst of your self-criticism. Fortunately, Mercury\u2019s arrival in your values zone on September 5th boosts your view of yourself and helps you to understand how much others love you.\n\nNonetheless, Virgo, you\u2019ll want to spend some time alone or only with those you love the most once Venus moves into your privacy zone on September 6th \u2013 and Mars turns retrograde in your psychology zone on September 9th, leaving you feeling insular and with a lot on your mind. The situation is not helped by a tricky Sun-Neptune opposition activating your love zone on September 11th. However, the answer lies in the Virgo New Moon on September 17th, which breezes in and completely resets your self-esteem compass, in a very good way.\n\nWith the Sun arriving in your money zone at the equinox on September 22nd, you have every reason to feel positive later in the month.

    "6": "Don\u2019t be surprised if you feel a little insecure during the Full Moon on September 2nd, which coincides with a difficult Mercury-Pluto trine. It continues with a Venus-Saturn opposition which highlights shaky foundations; this itself is swiftly followed the next day by a Mercury-Saturn trine which plays on vague fears and worries. However, the air clears quite suddenly on September 5th when intelligent Mercury arrives in your own sign, dispelling anxieties and calming nerves. It also helps that Venus moves into your social zone on September 6th, so friends will rally around.\n\nIt\u2019s a reflective month for your love life, with Mars turning retrograde in your love zone on September 9th.

It\u2019s all systems go once more at the equinox on September 22nd, when the Sun moves into Libra at the start of your sign\u2019s personal new year. You have every reason for optimism now, especially once Mercury moves into your money zone on September 27th and sets to work improving your finances.",
    "7": "Gossip, lies and social media madness are in full effect during the Full Moon on September 2nd and its associated Mercury-Pluto trine. Try as you might to ignore all this, the Venus-Saturn opposition on the same day puts you front and center in a potential scandal; this is not helped by rumor and speculation from friends who should know better on September 3rd.

    "8": "The Full Moon on September 2nd is in your family zone, but it highlights ways in which you feel you\u2019ve failed here, including potentially financially, thanks to an unhelpful Mercury-Pluto trine the day prior. The Venus-Saturn opposition on September 2nd also focuses on financial difficulties, and the Mercury-Saturn trine on September 3rd reveals a situation where increased responsibility at work has not been matched by increased rewards. When Mercury moves into your objectives zone on September 5th, you can start to make a strategic plan to get things back on course. Venus moves into your ideals zone on September 6th, which is good news, as this helps you earn money without compromising your principles.\n\nDon\u2019t be tempted to take financial risks during this period, though.

Finally, the financial pressure falls away when Saturn turns direct in your money zone on September 29th \u2013 patience has paid off.",
    "9": "Freedom is a big issue this September, starting from September 2nd when the Full Moon and a Mercury-Pluto trine highlight how you\u2019re being expected to \u2018fit in\u2019. On the same day, the pressure to conform gets personal, with a Venus-Saturn opposition afflicting your love life, and on the 3rd, a Mercury-Saturn trine also tugs at your desire for greater independence of choice in life. Mercury\u2019s arrival in your status zone on September 5th reminds you why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, but you\u2019ll still feel resentful and ill at ease \u2013 and, when Venus moves into your jealousy zone on September 6th, possibly envious of those who you think have more freedom.\n\nGradually, however, you\u2019ll start to realize that the grass isn\u2019t greener anywhere else. When Mars turns retrograde in your family zone on September 9th, you\u2019ll see how other family members you\u2019ve been resenting also have their own issues. When the Sun opposes Neptune on September 11th, you\u2019ll also learn that much of the freedom you see in others is illusory. We\u2019ve all got responsibilities. And baggage.\n\nThe turning point comes out of the blue with a delightful surprise on September 15th, courtesy of the Venus-Uranus square. This \u2018gift\u2019, whatever form it takes, gives you the freedom to step out of your self-defined box \u2013 and then the New Moon on September 17th occurs in your exploration zone, setting you most definitely free.

    "10": "Personal growth and spiritual growth are inextricably linked this September, starting with the Full Moon in your skills zone on September 2nd, which highlights areas of yourself you would like to develop. The Venus-Saturn opposition on the same day tugs at your spiritual heartstrings, but the Mercury-Saturn trine on September 3rd underscores your commitment to rationality and your inherent distrust of all things mystical. This will start to change from September 5th, however, when Mercury moves into your idealism and philosophy zone and opens your eyes to a whole new world. Likewise, when the Sun opposes Neptune on September 11th, mystical experiences will delight and entrance you, and feed your curiosity in a very positive way.\n\nIn love, much of September seems delightful, especially once Venus moves into your love zone on September 6th.

    "11": "September is a good month for sorting out your long-term vision and strategy, Pisces. The Full Moon in Pisces on September 2nd is a very emotional moment, but you may feel lost at sea and insecure because you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going. A Venus-Saturn opposition on the same day suggests that you and your partner differ in your objectives too, which will need addressing \u2013 although a Mercury-Saturn trine on September 3rd shows that communication on this front isn\u2019t necessarily easy.\n\nFortunately, Mercury\u2019s arrival in your strategy zone on September 5th is just what you need to start to make sense of the future. Couple this with Venus arrival in your sensible, everyday routines zone, and you can see how this combination is good for planning and thinking ahead. Communication with your sweetheart should get easier too, although watch out for a misunderstanding when the Sun-Neptune opposition clouds the issue around September 11th.\n\nGood organization and sensible thinking pay off on or near September 15th, with a very helpful surprise arising from your being in the right place at the right time. Coupled with a New Moon in your love zone on September 17th, it looks as though you and your sweetheart are finally on the same page and making progress \u2013 just in time for the Sun\u2019s arrival in your passion zone during the equinox on September 22nd.
